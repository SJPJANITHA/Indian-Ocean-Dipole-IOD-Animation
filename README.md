The IOD is a large-scale climate phenomenon where sea surface temperatures (SST) in the western and eastern Indian Ocean oscillate in opposite directions:

◾ Positive IOD → Western Indian Ocean warms, Eastern Indian Ocean cools
◾ Negative IOD → Eastern Indian Ocean warms, Western Indian Ocean cools

These temperature contrasts alter surface wind patterns, ocean circulation, rainfall distribution, and can strongly influence floods & droughts, monsoon variability, regional climate extremes across Asia, Africa, and Australia.

I recently developed an animation using python comparing two contrasting Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) periods:
🔹 2019 - 2022 
🔹 1997 - 2016

◾ SST anomalies (ocean temperature departures from normal)
◾ The western and eastern dipole “poles” where the contrast is strongest
◾ Direct comparison between opposite IOD phases and their differences
